# Compiler Optimizations  

Implementation of three compiler optimization techniques based on research papers. Each optimization technique is implemented in its respective directory.  

## Optimization Techniques  

### 1. Loop Interchange  
**Paper:** [Optimizing for Cache Performance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/502874.502897)  
**Implementation:** `Loop_Interchange/lab/Loop_Interchange.py`  

### 2. Loop Tiling  
**Paper:** [Parameterized Tiled Loops for Free](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220752166_Parameterized_Tiled_Loops_for_Free)  
**Implementation:** `Loop_Tiling/lab/Loop_Tiling.py`  

### 3. Operator Fusion  
**Paper:** Not specified  
**Implementation:** `Operator_Fusion/lab/Operator_Fusion.py`  

Each technique is implemented based on insights from research papers to improve performance and efficiency in compiled code.
